# Advent of Code 2021 (Clojure)

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

The code is arranged as follows:

- Source files in the `src/safehammad` folder are named name according to day.
- The `resources` folder contains input data for each day. Some example data extracted from the puzzle text has also been included.
- The `test` folder contains unit tests which only assert that the final result for parts 1 and 2 are correct.
